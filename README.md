# Chrome_Extension
### Problem I am trying to solve?

Due to Covid 19, remote learning has been a constant and so have been online examinations. 
<br />
But proctoring has always been a task and cheating and unfair practices have always been a problem.
<br />

`extension`: Chrome/Edge extension to keep a track of browser tabs.


**Extension**

- Open new tab & type: `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
- Look for the Developer mode toggle & turn it on if it's not already.
- After cloning the repository, click on `Load Unpacked` and select the `extension` directory.

**My Insight**

- In this chrome Extension i couldn't add all the requirements in the Assignment given.
But i have tried my level best based on my skills to add requires features to it for 
exam procurring.

- I have already started learning technology like APIs to access Webcams and Audio that was
required in the given assignment.As of now i couldn't add these features to it as it was out of sight
of my knowledge but I will definetly implement these features soon.

- I got to learn lots of technologies and new things in between of completion of this assignment like 
managing Manifest files to build chrome extension, React WEBCAM API - 

[react-webcam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webcam)

[devtools-detect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devtools-detect)

- Since I am a Fresher I couldn't add all requirements of the assignment but as of now i have already started
learning techs associated with building chrome extension and i'll be implementing it soon.


After learning those techs i will be Implementing Checks for cheating things in Chrome Extension:-

**Checks for cheating**

- Face Verification
- Voice Detection
- Multiple People Detection
- Dev Tools Check
- Multiple Tabs Check
- Full Screen Check
